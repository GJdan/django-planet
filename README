django planet
=============

This is a generic application for Django projects aiming to provide a planet
feed aggregator app.

Django-planet is heavily based on Feedjack's [1] models by Gustavo Pic√≥n and my
django app that extends it: feedjack-extension [2]. Changes and addings to
models were inspired by Mark Pilgrim's Feedparser [3].

Summary of changes with respect to feedjack and feedjack-extension code:
    
    * Link model was dropped.
    * Site models replaced by django.contrib.sites.Site model :)
    * Tag model replaced by tagging.Tag model.
    * Added Blog model (a Blog may have several related Feed objects).
    * Subscriber model renamed to Author, and was modifyed since a Blog may
      have several authors. Authors may be of two types: author or contributor.
    * Feed model was changed. New attributes added to store info provided by
      Feedparser.
    * Added FeedLink, PostLink, Enclosure and Generator models to store info
      provided by Feedparser.

    * Custom managers for each model.
    * New urls and detail and list views for each new model.

TODO:

    * Feeds (RSS and Atom): for all posts, for posts filtered by tag, author,
    blog, feed or any of its combinations.
    * setup.py, pack it into and egg and upload it to Python Python Package Index.
    * Make a beauty CSS and add icons.

    * Some other features inspired by semantic attributes of RSS and Atom feeds :P
